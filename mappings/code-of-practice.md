# Code of Practice for Consumer IoT Security



| [Code of Practice for Consumer IoT Security](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/code-of-practice-for-consumer-iot-security) | **Description** | \*\*\*\*[**OWASP IoT Top 10 Mapping**](https://www.owasp.org/images/1/1c/OWASP-IoT-Top-10-2018-final.pdf)\*\*\*\* |

| **1. No default passwords** | All IoT device passwords shall be unique and not resettable to any universal factory default value | **I1 Weak, Guessable, or Hardcoded Passwords** |
| **2. Implement a vulnerability disclosure policy** | All companies that provide internet-connected devices and services shall provide a public point of contact as part of a vulnerability disclosure policy in order that security researchers and others are able to report issues. Disclosed vulnerabilities should be acted on in a timely manner. | **N/A** |
| **3. Keep software updated** | Software components in internet-connected devices should be securely updateable. Updates shall be timely and should not impact on the functioning of the device. An end-of-life policy shall be published for end-point devices which explicitly states the minimum length of time for which a device will receive software updates and the reasons for the length of the support period. The need for each update should be made clear to consumers and an update should be easy to implement. For constrained devices that cannot physically be updated, the product should be isolatable and replaceable. | **I4 Lack of Secure Update Mechanism**  **I8 Lack of Device Management** |
| **4. Securely store credentials and security-sensitive data** | Any credentials shall be stored securely within services and on devices. Hard-coded credentials in device software are not acceptable. | **I7 Insecure Data Transfer and Storage** |
| **5. Communicate securely** | Security-sensitive data, including any remote management and control, should be encrypted in transit, appropriate to the properties of the technology and usage. All keys should be managed securely. | **I3 Insecure Ecosystem Interfaces**  **I7 Insecure Data Transfer and Storage** |
| **6. Minimise exposed attack surfaces** | All devices and services should operate on the ‘principle of least privilege’; unused ports should be closed, hardware should not unnecessarily expose access, services should not be available if they are not used and code should be minimised to the functionality necessary for the service to operate. Software should run with appropriate privileges, taking account of both security and functionality. | **I2 Insecure Network Services**  **I5 Use of Insecure or Outdated Components** |
| **7. Ensure software integrity** | Software on IoT devices should be verified using secure boot mechanisms. If an unauthorised change is detected, the device should alert the consumer/administrator to an issue and should not connect to wider networks than those necessary to perform the alerting function. | **I9 Insecure Default Settings**  **I10 Lack of Physical Hardening** |
| **8. Ensure that personal data is protected** | Where devices and/or services process personal data, they shall do so in accordance with applicable data protection law, such as the General Data Protection Regulation \(GDPR\) and the Data Protection Act 2018. Device manufacturers and IoT service providers shall provide consumers with clear and transparent information about how their data is being used, by whom, and for what purposes, for each device and service. This also applies to any third parties that may be involved \(including advertisers\). Where personal data is processed on the basis of consumers’ consent, this shall be validly and lawfully obtained, with those consumers being given the opportunity to withdraw it at any time. | **I6 Insufficient Privacy Protection** |
| **9. Make systems resilient to outages** | Resilience should be built in to IoT devices and services where required by their usage or by other relying systems, taking into account the possibility of outages of data networks and power. As far as reasonably possible, IoT services should remain operating and locally functional in the case of a loss of network and should recover cleanly in the case of restoration of a loss of power. Devices should be able to return to a network in a sensible state and in an orderly fashion, rather than in a massive scale reconnect. | **I8 Lack of Device Management**  **I9 Insecure Default Settings** |
| **10. Monitor system telemetry data** | If telemetry data is collected from IoT devices and services, such as usage and measurement data, it should be monitored for security anomalies. | **N/A** |
| **11. Make it easy for consumers to delete personal data** | Devices and services should be configured such that personal data can easily be removed from them when there is a transfer of ownership, when the consumer wishes to delete it and/or when the consumer wishes to dispose of the device. Consumers should be given clear instructions on how to delete their personal data. | **I6 Insufficient Privacy Protection** |
| **12. Make installation and maintenance of devices easy** | Installation and maintenance of IoT devices should employ minimal steps and should follow security best practice on usability. Consumers should also be provided with guidance on how to securely set up their device. | **I8 Lack of Device Management**  **I9 Insecure Default Settings** |
| **13. Validate input data** | Data input via user interfaces and transferred via application programming interfaces \(APIs\) or between networks in services and devices shall be validated. | **I3 Insecure Ecosystem Interfaces** |
